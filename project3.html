            <p>Created a light detector using Arduino-UNO to increase the intensity of the solar panel which moves according to light sourcs.It is helpful in Agriculture field.
                 <br>An Arduino Uno project on a light detecting solar system involves the use of an Arduino Uno microcontroller board, light sensors, and a servo motor to track and follow the sun's path. The basic principle behind the project is to create a system that can detect the sun's location in the sky and move a solar panel to face it directly, ensuring maximum energy production.
              <br>The light sensors are used to detect the sun's position in the sky and send signals to the Arduino Uno board. The board then calculates the angle at which the solar panel needs to be tilted to face the sun and sends a signal to the servo motor to adjust the panel's position.

              The Arduino Uno is a popular microcontroller board used in various electronic projects due to its ease of use and versatility. It is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, which is clocked at 16 MHz and has 32 KB of flash memory for program storage.
               
            <br>The light sensors used in the project can be either photodiodes or photoresistors, which detect light intensity and convert it into an electrical signal. These sensors are usually placed on either side of the solar panel to detect the position of the sun in the sky.

            The servo motor is used to adjust the angle of the solar panel based on the signals received from the light sensors. Servo motors are commonly used in robotics and other motion control applications and are known for their precision and accuracy.
     <br>Overall, the light detecting solar system project using Arduino Uno is an excellent example of how microcontroller boards can be used in real-world applications to solve practical problems. This project can help to maximize solar energy production by ensuring that solar panels are always facing the sun and can be an excellent learning experience for students and hobbyists interested in electronics and renewable energy.
