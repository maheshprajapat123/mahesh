            <p>Created a Helicopter air wings with using Catia V-5.
              <br>The airfoil shape of a helicopter rotor is designed to create a higher air pressure on the bottom surface of the rotor blade and a lower air pressure on the top surface. As the rotor blades rotate, this pressure difference generates lift, allowing the helicopter to take off and fly.
              <br>In addition to generating lift, helicopter rotors also provide directional control and stability. The pitch of the rotor blades can be adjusted to change the direction of the lift force and control the direction of the helicopter. The collective pitch control changes the pitch of all the rotor blades together to increase or decrease the lift force, while the cyclic pitch control changes the pitch of each rotor blade independently to control the direction of the lift force.
              <br>Designing helicopter air wings is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of aerodynamics, material properties, and manufacturing techniques. The airfoil shape, thickness, and orientation of the rotor blades are carefully designed to achieve the desired lift, directional control, and stability. Advanced computer simulations and wind tunnel testing are often used to refine the design and optimize the performance of helicopter rotors.
